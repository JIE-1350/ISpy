# Intelligent Scraping with Python (ISpy)

The main goal of this project is to provide an easy user interface allowing for a decreased time in searching the web and more time studying and analyzing trends. The collection of information will enable various users (such as social scientists and academics) to view top trends, identify solutions, and perform insight analysis. Looking at the significant impact social media has had on the 21st-century global society, we can see how easily and quickly misinformation can spread through platforms such as Twitter. This misinformation can lead to a significant amount of divisive and harmful opinions. For example, this past year of the global pandemic has shown how misinformation such as conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines can quickly spread and lead to harmful effects like preventing many people from getting vaccinated. Using our python scraper, users will be provided with accurate and unbiased data; as a result, allowing for the common benefit of society.â€¯Some of the key features within our application will be collecting data from Twitter, applying filters to sort and organize data, providing various insights on collected data, and saving collected information for later use.

## Installation
### Frontend
#### Requirements
* nodeJS 16.13.0 or newer (LTS)
* npm

#### Setup

```cd frontend/```

```npm install```

#### Run frontend only
```npm start```

#### Run frontend and backend
```npm run dev```

---

### Backend
#### Setup
Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```cd backend/```

```python3 -m venv venv```

```source venv/bin/activate```

```pip install -r requirements.txt```


#### Run manually for testing:

```python server.py```

## Build Installer
Before you start building the installer, make sure that you can run the application in development setting.

Make sure that your virtual environment is activated, and **pyinstaller** is installed.

Create an executable for the python server.

To start, change directory to `backend/pyinstaller/`

`cd backend/pyinstaller/`

Run the sh script to create the executable. 

`sh create_exe.sh`

The executable should be in `backend/pyinstaller/dist/` folder with the name `server.exe`

There should also be a copy of `server.exe` in `frontend/`.

Change directory to `frontend/`

`cd ../../frontend`

Run the script to build the electron application installer

`npm run electron:build`

The installer should be in `frontend/dist/` folder as `ISpy Setup 0.1.0.exe`
